# Introduction
Peer-to-peer lending is the practice of lending money to individuals or businesses through online services that match lenders with borrowers.
“Lending Club” is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.
The interest rates can be set by lenders who compete for the lowest rate on the reverse auction model or fixed by the intermediary company on the basis of an analysis of the borrower's credit.
There is the risk of the borrower defaulting on the loans taken out from peer-lending websites.
